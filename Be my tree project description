# Be My Tree 🌳

## 🌱 Inspiration
What we do today affects our future. Every minute spent thinking about how we can make our environment better is valuable. **Be My Tree** is designed to involve ourselves and others in environmental conservation, inspiring action to give back to nature, which has given us everything.

## 🌍 What It Does
Our mission is to provide people with an **easy way to contribute to nature**. Here's how it works:

1. 📲 **Download the app**
2. 📍 **Select a nearby location** from a list of parks, non-profits, or private citizens who have partnered with us
3. 🌳 **Choose a tree** from a curated selection that best suits the local environment
4. 📅 **Schedule an appointment** with the location manager
5. 💳 **Pay for the visit** and receive all necessary planting equipment upon arrival
6. 🏷️ **Plant your tree and tag it** with your name, making it a lasting memory

This process **connects people** who want to **make a meaningful environmental impact** with a simple tool, supporting **local organizations** and creating **jobs** in the process.

## 🛠️ How We Built It
- 🎨 **Design:** Valeriia, our team’s designer, created a user-friendly interface
- 💻 **Development:** I built an interactive app for iPhone, iPad, and MacOS
- 🔍 **Research:** We studied government programs and environmental policies to ensure the feasibility of the idea

## 🚧 Challenges We Ran Into
### 1️⃣ **Finding Locations**
- It was difficult to identify sites that would allow public tree planting.
- However, the **New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC)** has programs like **“New York’s 25 Million Trees”**, which provide funding and support for tree planting efforts.
  - 🌿 Expanding tree seedling production
  - 📚 Educating people about deforestation
  - 💰 Offering funding for private & public landowners
- DEC also launched the **Regenerate New York Forestry Cost Share Grant Program**, making it easier to collaborate with investors and landowners.

### 2️⃣ **Tree Selection Constraints**
- Initially, users could plant **any tree** they wanted.
- However, after mentorship sessions with **Shitangshu Roy**, we realized that only **location-appropriate species** should be planted to prevent invasive species and maintain ecological balance.
- We now follow **DEC recommendations** to ensure sustainability.

### 3️⃣ **Cloud & Sustainability Concerns**
- Scaling the app will require cloud infrastructure.
- Hosting servers may **not always run on green energy**, which we need to address in future updates.
